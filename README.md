# VR Project


The VRProject works to provide visually impaired individuals with the ability to navigate certain test cases and, hopefully,
to even play video games that were originally made with the intention of visual sight.

The project is currently being made with Dr. Glenn Gunhouse from GSU. View more of his work at [medievalist.net](http://medievalist.net/).
